/*
    Phone Number Rules:

    For this exercise, we'll consider North American phone numbers, 
    which typically follow the format (NPA) NXX-XXXX, where:

        NPA (Numbering Plan Area) is the area code.
        NXX is the central office code, and it must not start with 0 or 1.
        XXXX is the line number.

    Add a regex pattern that will match the phone number rules above as valid.
